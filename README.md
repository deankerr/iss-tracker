# ISS Tracker

[Live version](http://dk-iss-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

(This project was an assignment during my React Development course at General Assembly)

A React app which plots the location of the International Space Station on a Google Maps component. You can also click 
anywhere on the map to load the weather from the closest weather station and display it on the map.

### TODO
Refactor app from being class based to use functional components/hooks
